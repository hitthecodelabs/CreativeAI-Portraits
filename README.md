# CreativeAI-Portraits

## Project Overview
This portfolio showcases images generated using various versions of Stable Diffusion models, including the SDXL-Turbo. The images were created in a Colab notebook and demonstrate the model's capability to generate detailed, creative, and complex images from textual prompts.

### Objectives
- To explore and compare the capabilities of different versions of Stable Diffusion.
- To create a diverse set of images based on a range of prompts, showcasing creativity and detail.
- To serve as a mini-portfolio demonstrating the potential applications of AI-generated art.

## Generated Images

Below are the images generated using the specified versions of Stable Diffusion, along with the prompts used.

### SDXL-Turbo Version Images

#### 1. Futuristic Cityscape at Dusk
**Prompt**: "A serene landscape featuring a crystal-clear lake mirroring the vibrant, fiery hues of a sunset, with majestic mountains in the background and a field of wildflowers in the foreground."

#### 2. Ancient Library Lost to Time
**Prompt**: "An astronaut exploring a neon-lit alien marketplace, filled with various extraterrestrial species trading exotic goods, under a sky with three moons."

... (Include other images and prompts similarly)

### Another Version of Stable Diffusion

... (Include images generated with another version of Stable Diffusion)

## Technical Details

- **Environment**: Google Colab Notebook
- **Models Used**: SDXL-Turbo and [other version]
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, PyTorch, diffusers library

## Observations and Insights

(Share any observations or insights you gained from creating these images. Discuss the differences you noticed between the different versions of Stable Diffusion, the challenges faced, and any interesting details about the prompts and the resulting images.)

## How to Use

(Provide instructions on how users can generate their own images using your Colab notebook. Include any requirements or steps they need to follow.)

## Future Work

(Outline any potential future expansions or experiments you plan to conduct with Stable Diffusion or other models.)
