# CreativeAI-Portraits

## Project Overview
This portfolio showcases images generated using various versions of Stable Diffusion models, including the SDXL-Turbo. The images were created in a Colab notebook and demonstrate the model's capability to generate detailed, creative, and complex images from textual prompts.

### Objectives
- To explore and compare the capabilities of different versions of Stable Diffusion.
- To create a diverse set of images based on a range of prompts, showcasing creativity and detail.
- To serve as a mini-portfolio demonstrating the potential applications of AI-generated art.

## Generated Images

Below are the images generated using the specified versions of Stable Diffusion, along with the prompts used.

### SDXL Version Images

#### 1. Serene Lake Sunset Mountains
**Prompt**: "A serene landscape featuring a crystal-clear lake mirroring the vibrant, fiery hues of a sunset, with majestic mountains in the background and a field of wildflowers in the foreground."
